# Profile Card Challenge - Frontend Tribe

This challenge will test your skills around flexbox, border radius and box shadows.

## Viewing the designs

The designs are included in both PNG and Figma format.  Although the PNG will give you a general idea of how the design should look when complete, we recommend using Figma to get the most accurate values for creating your finished project.  You can download Figma [here](https://www.figma.com/downloads/).  Simply download the desktop app and drag and drop the Figma design into the app to use the design.

Once you have the designs and are ready to start coding, there are 2 options for development: developing locally and uploading to a hosting provider or developing in a Cloud IDE. 

## Developing with a Cloud IDE

For beginners, we recommend developing in a Cloud IDE for simplicity, and because your project will already by online when you're ready to have it automatically scored. 

We've created a free starter template with replit to get you started.  Just click the link below and click on the "Fork" button to create your own copy and get started coding.

## Developing locally

To help you get started, we've included a starter template located in the `template` directory.  You can edit the files directly from there and open up the `index.html` file in your browser to see the results.

Once you're done with the project, in order to be automatically scored you'll need to get it online where it's publicly accessible.  There are several great free hosting options for your project, should you choose to host your project.  We recommend the following providers:

- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)

## Submitting Your Challenge

Once you're happy with your code, it's time to submit it to frontendtribe.com to see how close you came to a pixel-perfect solution.  To do that, just navigate to where you downloaded the challenge and click the button to submit your solution.
